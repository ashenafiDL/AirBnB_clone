# 0x0. AirBnB clone - The console

This is the first part of the ALX's AirBnB clone project.

In this project we built the console - a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.

The command interpreter will be able to do the following things:-

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ashenafiDL/AirBnB_clone.git

2. Change your directory

```

3. Run the script
